# Communicating-Me
I am Tiago Martins, I am a typical car guy who enjoys long gaming sessions, old animes and drawing. I'm a hard worker who often puts pressure on himself to improve everyday and set expections higher and higher. I aspire to be a software engineer and I often love researching and learning about my hobbies and interests. This assignment helped me reflect on who I am and my characteristics. This was more than just an assignment this was a inside to my aspirations and thought process, in a way the restrictions given helped me ponder on how to describe myself in little words but still being able to get the point across.
