CMPG 214 - Communicating me reflection

During this assignment I had to undergo a lot of design choices which often had me at war with myself. The hardest part was trying to decide on what actually represented me in a logo. I had played around with a lot of ideas, but I had originally set on a turbo with a goblin hand that grabbed it to represent my passion for cars and gaming and decided to scrap it as I felt it was too plain to represent me. After 2 days of me sketching and fighting with this logo that I could not escape and kept making logos similar to my original idea, I was then inspired by one of my favorite cars the Dodge super bee and its logo and made a twist of my own and made the bumble boost. The next challenge was designing the Infographic, in which my original version did not sit well with me until with some help I moved things around to make my final version. Overall I feel like my design embraces the chaos and presents in it a presentable way, and I feel like it matches my character conveying a message of, "for there to be beauty there needs to be chaos".
