CMPG 214 - SU2 reflection

During todays class activity I was part of the Visual and Clarity team. At the beginning it was vague to understand what was required from us but once we were able to understand what we were able to do then next challenge was translating the complex jargon used in the original slide to put in plain English where it still kept its meaning. Other than that the only other challenge I had was trying to present and getting the urgency and content across within 3 minutes. I often found myself stumbling over words and mixing up a few of my points but I able effectively convey the message. I feel that the communication failed at the beginning with the email, the CIO used words that the CEO was unable to understand and ultimately not treat it as a urgent matter. If i had to do it differently I feel like a phone call or a voice note would be much more effective in giving the matter the urgency it needs as well as being able to rectify the meaning of the complex jargon used.
